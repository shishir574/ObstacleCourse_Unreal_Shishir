# ObstacleCourse_Unreal_Shishir
### Overview

**Obstacle Course** is a 3D puzzle platformer built in Unreal Engine, utilizing Unreal Blueprints and C++ to create a challenging and engaging player experience. The game is set in a world of floating, rotating, and moving islands, each containing a magical stone that teleports the player to the next island once reached.

### Features

- **Unreal Engine Blueprints and C++**: Combines the power of Blueprints and C++ to create an optimized, flexible gameplay experience.
- **Dynamic Environment**: The islands are in constant motion – rotating and floating – challenging the player to master timing and strategy.
- **Obstacles**: Each island presents new obstacles that require careful navigation and precision to overcome.
- **Magical Stones**: The goal of each level is to reach a magical stone, which teleports the player to the next island for a new challenge.
- **Immersive 3D World**: Stunning visuals and smooth mechanics to bring the floating islands and magical elements to life.

### Technology Stack

- **Unreal Engine 5**
- **Blueprints & C++**
- **Visual Studio**

### How to Play

1. **Navigate** through the moving and rotating islands.
2. **Overcome obstacles** to reach the magical stone on each island.
3. Upon reaching the stone, you’ll be **teleported** to the next island.
4. Continue until all islands are conquered!

### Development Process

The development of *Obstacle Course* followed an iterative approach, blending **Unreal Blueprints** with **C++** to create a dynamic and engaging puzzle platformer.

#### 1. Concept and Design
The project began by defining key mechanics, such as teleportation between islands, moving platforms, and obstacles. Level design focused on creating progressively challenging floating islands with varied movement and traps.

#### 2. Environment Creation
The 3D world was crafted using Unreal Engine’s environment tools. Floating islands, magical stones, and dynamic lighting were designed to create a visually immersive world. Post-processing effects and materials were used to enhance the atmosphere.

#### 3. Gameplay Development
Core gameplay features like teleportation, character movement, and obstacle interaction were implemented. Blueprints handled rapid prototyping and level scripting, while **C++** was used for optimized performance and critical game logic.

#### 4. Integration of Blueprints and C++
Blueprints were used for visual scripting, while C++ handled player movement, collision detection, and advanced obstacle behaviors, ensuring smooth gameplay and responsive controls.
